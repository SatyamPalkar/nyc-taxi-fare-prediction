## üìà Analysis Components

### Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (Q1)

**Key Questions:**
- Which day of the week had the most trips?
- Which hour of the day had the most trips?
- What was the average number of passengers?
- What was the average fare per trip and per passenger?

**Key Findings:**
- Trip volumes peaked in 2013-2014 at over 16M trips/month
- COVID-19 caused a dramatic drop to 263K trips in April 2020
- Recovery to ~3M trips/month by 2023-2024
- Average passenger count remained stable at ~1.6 passengers/trip

### Part 2: Trip Characteristics (Q2)

**Metrics Analyzed:**
- Average, median, min, max trip duration (minutes)
- Average, median, min, max trip distance (km)
- Average, median, min, max speed (km/h)

**Key Findings:**
- **Green Taxis**: 13.8 min avg, 3.05 km avg, 12.8 km/h avg speed
- **Yellow Taxis**: 14.4 min avg, 3.06 km avg, 11.8 km/h avg speed
- Median trip duration: ~11 minutes
- Median trip distance: ~2 km
- Most trips are short, low-speed urban journeys

### Part 3: Borough Flow Analysis (Q3-Q4)

**Analysis Approach:**
This section leverages **Spark SQL on Databricks** for distributed aggregations:
```sql
-- Executed on Databricks using %sql magic command
-- Processes 977M records using distributed GROUP BY
SELECT
  taxi_color, pickup_borough, dropoff_borough,
  YEAR(pickup_datetime) AS year,
  COUNT(*) AS total_trips,
  ROUND(AVG(trip_distance), 2) AS avg_distance_km,
  ROUND(SUM(total_amount), 2) AS total_amount_paid
FROM taxi_trips_cleaned
GROUP BY taxi_color, pickup_borough, dropoff_borough, YEAR(pickup_datetime)
ORDER BY total_trips DESC;
```

**Analysis Breakdown:**
- Total trips by borough pair
- Average distance per route
- Average fare per trip
- Total revenue by pickup‚Üídropoff combinations

**Revenue Insights:**
| Route | Revenue | % of Total |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Manhattan ‚Üí Manhattan | $708.6M | 62.6% |
| Queens ‚Üí Manhattan | $171.7M | 15.2% |
| Manhattan ‚Üí Queens | $73.8M | 6.5% |
| Queens ‚Üí Brooklyn | ~3.4% | 3.4% |
| Manhattan ‚Üí Brooklyn | ~2.9% | 2.9% |

**Top 10 borough pairs account for 97.2% of total revenue**

### Part 4: Tipping Behavior (Q5-Q6)

**Q5: Percentage of trips with tips**
- **62.8%** of trips included tips (613.9M out of 977.3M)

**Q6: High-value tips (‚â•$15)**
- Only **0.83%** of tipped trips had tips ‚â•$15 (5.1M out of 613.9M)
- Most tips are modest; generous tips are rare

### Part 5: Duration Analysis (Q7-Q8)

**Trip Duration Bins:**
| Duration | Total Trips | Avg Fare | Fare/Minute |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Under 5 mins | High volume | $7 | $2.34 |
| 5-10 mins | Very high | $12 | $1.50 |
| 10-20 mins | **342M** (highest) | **$16.41** | **$1.16** |
| 20-30 mins | Moderate | $23 | $1.15 |
| 30-60 mins | Lower | $47 | ‚â§$1.25 |
| 60+ mins | Rare | $71 | Low |

**Q8: Optimal Duration for Drivers**
- **Recommendation: Target 10-20 minute trips**
- Reasons:
  - Highest trip volume (342M trips)
  - Balanced fare ($16.41 avg)
  - Sustainable efficiency ($1.16/min)
  - Best for maximizing daily income

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Implementation

### Models Evaluated
1. **Baseline Model** (Mean predictor)
2. **Linear Regression**
3. **Random Forest Regressor**

### Feature Engineering
```python
features = [
    "trip_distance", "duration_sec", "tip_amount", "speed_kph",
    "airport_fee", "improvement_surcharge", "extra",
    "pickup_month", "pickup_dow", "pickup_hour",
    "PULocationID", "DOLocationID",
    "fare_efficiency",  # tip_amount / trip_distance
    "duration_per_km"   # duration_sec / trip_distance
]
```

### Train/Test Split
- **Training Data**: All trips before Oct 2024
- **Test Data**: Oct-Dec 2024 (holdout period)
- **Sample Size**: 1% random sample (~9.7M trips) for computational efficiency

### Model Performance (RMSE)

| Model | RMSE | Improvement vs Baseline |
|-------|------|------------------------|
| Baseline (Mean) | 25.9 | - |
| Linear Regression | 10.0 | 61% reduction |
| **Random Forest** | **4.6** | **82% reduction** |

### Best Model: Random Forest
- **Hyperparameters**: 100 estimators, max_depth=12
- **RMSE on Holdout Set**: 4.6
- **Why it works**: Captures non-linear relationships between distance, duration, surcharges, and location features

## üîç Data Cleaning Methodology

### Databricks + Spark Approach
Data cleaning on **Databricks** leverages distributed processing to handle 1B+ records efficiently:
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Transformations are optimized before execution
- **Distributed Filtering**: Filters applied across cluster nodes in parallel
- **Column-level Operations**: PySpark's vectorized operations for speed
- **Catalyst Optimizer**: Automatic query optimization by Spark SQL

### Cleaning Filters Applied
```python
def clean_trips_percentile(df):
    # Applied using PySpark DataFrame API
    # Duration: 30 sec - 200 min (12,000 sec)
    # Distance: 0.1 km - 100 km
    # Speed: 0 - 120 km/h (excluding nulls)
    # Passenger count: 1-6 (impute 0/null ‚Üí 1, cap at 6)
    # Valid datetime range: 2009-2024
    # Remove future dates, negative fares, invalid locations
    
    # Executed in parallel across Spark cluster
    df = df.filter(
        (col("duration_sec") >= 30) & (col("duration_sec") <= 12000)
    )
    # ... additional distributed filters
```

### Data Quality Metrics
- **Records Retained**: ~98.7% of original data
- **Records Removed**: ~1.3% (well within 10% threshold)
- **Removal Reasons**:
  - Invalid/future dates
  - Unrealistic speeds (>120 km/h)
  - Zero or negative fares
  - Missing critical location data
  - Green taxi records before 2013 (service didn't exist)

### Data Integration
- Unified Yellow and Green taxi schemas
- Added `taxi_color` field for differentiation
- Joined with location lookup to add borough information
- Created computed fields: `duration_sec`, `speed_kph`

## üìä Key Insights & Business Recommendations

### For Taxi Drivers
1. **Target 10-20 minute trips** for optimal income/time ratio
2. **Focus on Manhattan routes** (62%+ of revenue)
3. **Airport runs** (Queens-Manhattan) are highly profitable
4. **Peak hours**: Analyze hourly patterns in your borough

### For Fleet Operators
1. **Manhattan-centric operations** dominate revenue
2. **Queens-Manhattan corridor** is the second-most valuable
3. **Tipping culture is strong** (63% of trips) ‚Äî encourage quality service
4. **Short trips dominate volume** ‚Äî optimize for high turnover

### For Urban Planners
1. **Manhattan remains the taxi hub** despite decline since 2015
2. **COVID-19 impact was severe** but recovery is underway
3. **Inter-borough connectivity** is critical (Queens-Manhattan flow)
4. **Average speeds are low** (~12 km/h) ‚Äî traffic congestion is significant

## ‚ö° Performance & Scalability

### Why This Project Requires Databricks

Processing 977 million records is beyond the capability of traditional single-machine approaches:

| Metric | Scale | Databricks Advantage |
|--------|-------|---------------------|
| **Total Records** | 977M+ trips | Distributed across cluster nodes |
| **Data Size** | ~50GB+ Parquet | Parallel I/O with Parquet columnar format |
| **Aggregations** | Billion+ group operations | Spark's Catalyst optimizer + distributed shuffles |
| **Join Operations** | 977M √ó location lookup | Broadcast joins for efficiency |
| **ML Training** | 9.7M sample (1%) | pandas_udf for distributed feature engineering |

### Processing Time Estimates
On a **Databricks cluster** (4-8 workers, 32GB RAM each):
- **Data ingestion**: ~5-10 minutes
- **Data cleaning**: ~15-20 minutes
- **SQL aggregations**: ~10-15 minutes per complex query
- **ML model training**: ~5-10 minutes
- **Total runtime**: ~45-60 minutes

On a **single machine** (16GB RAM):
- Likely to run out of memory or take 6-12+ hours

### Optimization Techniques Used
1. **Parquet columnar format** for efficient column pruning
2. **Broadcast joins** for small dimension tables (location lookup)
3. **Partition pruning** by filtering on `pickup_datetime` year
4. **Lazy evaluation** to optimize execution plans
5. **Caching** intermediate DataFrames (`taxi_trips_cleaned`)
6. **Column pruning** to read only necessary fields
